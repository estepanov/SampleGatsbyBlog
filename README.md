# Sample Gatsby Blog

I wrote this because I was just playing around with gatsby while exploring adding a blog to my personal site. Feel free to use this code and do what you want with it. Uses markdown for formating and posts can be created by putting an `index.md` file inside of a date folder in `/src/pages/`.

## Install

Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

or

```sh
yarn
```

Then you can run it by:

```sh
gatsby develop
```
